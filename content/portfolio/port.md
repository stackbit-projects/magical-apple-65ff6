Never in my entire time at college have I been guilty of anything more than trying to enjoy the sun and the fine contrast in per diem moments and details, whenever and wherever possible. Although this still holds true to this day, there is something unparalleled about the college years. Maybe here we can see why.

### Rays

Heading into our first final of many to come, Dr. Zakaria, one of the college's finest arranges a final all round botany revision. All eyes on the black board. Being such an important curriculum, it was only natural for everyone to be in the same attentive state. Something to be easily seen in Abdulsamad's attitude.

### Recess

Being a scientist is synonymous with having long days and this definitely belongs to the longer ones. Combined with the fact that being in the lecture hall means that students are up for a series of uninterrupted lectures until the end of the day, you'll appreciate every single moment there is to rest. One couldn't miss a chance. In an attempt to utilize the few moments he got before the next lecture, Salah laid his head down on the desk while Anton, let's say he was savoring the moment.

### Playground: Competition

What's life without competition? Just like everything in life, competition  shapes the college experience like no other thing could. A tight game between freshmen and juniors, each managing only one goal on the scoresheet, everybody standing on the touchline, the wait is not over. Substituted before the final whistle, Ibrahim joins the rest of the crowd as he watches the last moments of the game unfold, a game that is yet to yield a winner.

### Conversation

On campus, different types of conversations take place everyday. While Ibrahim went to discuss some details of the upcoming botany exam others were enjoying a different type of conversation. Unless they, too, were talking about botany. We will never know.

### Playground: Horizons

New playground, new possibilities.

### Rain: First Perspective

It's getting gloomy out there! Only, it is not. Beloved as it is, for the warmth and joy it brings upon our world, something better was yet to make an appearance. Rain. Everything was in place. With the lecture coming to its end, faster than everybody she goes through the door and arrives at the playground to solely enjoy the rain; or at least she thought.

### Rain: Second Perspective

Sometimes the most contrastive events in life are just moments apart. This becomes more likely if the two events are experienced by two different people, and that was true here. A solo walk into the rain was followed by a group running into it. Complete silence versus confetti of words. All thanks to rain, everybody's best friend.
