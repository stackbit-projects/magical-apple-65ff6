You are in the personal zone of Ahmed R. Nassar. Scientist, blogger, and creator.

\[Biophysics\]

My curiosity and desire to build helped me create new interests and pick up new skills along the way to achieving whatever comes to my mind. Some of the these interests and skills are as old as I first remember the world and some are relatively new in comparison.

    var person = 'baby' ;
    
    if (person === 'baby') {
       
        print('kiss on the cheek') ; 
    }   else {
        print(oops, mademoiselle!)
    }

formidable, isn't it?
