My curiosity and desire to build and create helped me create new hobbies and pick up/master new skills along the way to achieving and obtaining whatever comes to my mind.  Some of the these hobbies and skills are as old as I first remember the world and some are relatively new in comparison.

The world always seems brighter when you’ve just made something that wasn’t there before. - Neil Gaiman

In sollicitudin imperdiet turpis quis accumsan. Pellentesque euismod turpis et nisi fermentum accumsan. Sed mollis vehicula augue sit amet accumsan. Nunc mollis, risus sed ullamcorper bibendum, odio est molestie tellus, venenatis rutrum mauris nibh at nibh. In a auctor leo, eu pretium ante. Quisque faucibus tincidunt fringilla. Donec tempor accumsan ante, in cursus metus tincidunt at. Proin sit amet ligula sed libero consequat consectetur eu tincidunt nulla.
